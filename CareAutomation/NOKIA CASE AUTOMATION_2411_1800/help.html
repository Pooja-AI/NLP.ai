It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development and licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM, 3G and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world, its dominance also extending into the smartphone industry. After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10] After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French-American telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global.[13] The company has had various industries in its 152-year history.
